These are codes of implementation of BoW and VLAD for image retrieval,
the whole process contains extracting/sampling features from images, training codebook, quantifying features from
images with the codebook and retrievaling images. The whole process is time-costly, so I uploaded the intermediate results (
includes sampled features, codebooks and normalized feature histograms) to Tencent weiyun to help restart the whole process from some certain stages to shorten the
time of whole process.
